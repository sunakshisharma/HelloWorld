# Modify the program from the Second Dictionary challenge of lecture 56
# to use shelves instead of dictionaries.
#
# Do this by creating two programs. cave_initialise.py should create the two
# shelves (locations and vocabulary) with the appropriate keys and values.
#
# cave_game.py will then use the two shelves instead of dictionaries.
# Apart from opening and closing the shelves, cave_game will need only
# two changes to the actual code - remember that shelf keys MUST be strings!
#
# Just to be clear, cave_game.py will contain the code from line 45, everything
# before that (modified to use shelves) will be in cave_initialise.py.
